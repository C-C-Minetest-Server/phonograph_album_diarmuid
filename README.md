# Phonograph Album: Diarmuid's Soundtracks

This mod includes soundtracks composed by Diarmuid. These tracks were intended to be part of Diarmuid's never-finished soundtrack mod. The original tracks can be found at <https://gitlab.com/diarmuidtherat/minetest-soundtrack>.

> Wrote a 41-track (they're all very short for the most part) soundtrack for Minetest like 4 years ago that was intended to be a part of a soundtrack mod, however the mod creator never finished it.
